RhinoSpider uses OpenAI's GPT models to enhance web scraping capabilities through intelligent content analysis, data extraction, and topic classification. The AI integration helps make the scraping process more accurate and adaptable.

## Key Features

### 1. Content Analysis
- Uses AI to analyze webpage content and determine its relevance to configured topics
- Identifies key information and data points within unstructured text
- Helps filter out irrelevant content and noise

### 2. Smart Data Extraction
- Dynamically adapts to different webpage layouts and structures
- Extracts structured data even when HTML patterns change
- Understands context and relationships between data points

### 3. Topic Classification
- Automatically categorizes content into configured topics
- Identifies subtopics and related themes
- Helps maintain organized and well-categorized data

## Configuration

### AI Settings
1. **API Key**: Your OpenAI API key for authentication

3. **Max Concurrent**: Number of simultaneous AI requests (1-10)

## Example Topics for Testing

### 1. Technology News
```json
{
  "name": "Tech News",
  "description": "Latest technology news and updates",
  "urlPatterns": [
    "techcrunch.com/*/",
    "theverge.com/tech/*"
  ],
  "extractionRules": {
    "fields": [
      {
        "name": "headline",
        "selector": "h1",
        "type": "text"
      },
      {
        "name": "author",
        "selector": ".author",
        "type": "text"
      },
      {
        "name": "content",
        "selector": "article",
        "type": "text"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 2. Product Reviews
```json
{
  "name": "Product Reviews",
  "description": "Consumer electronics reviews",
  "urlPatterns": [
    "cnet.com/reviews/*",
    "techradar.com/reviews/*"
  ],
  "extractionRules": {
    "fields": [
      {
        "name": "productName",
        "selector": "h1",
        "type": "text"
      },
      {
        "name": "rating",
        "selector": ".rating",
        "type": "number"
      },
      {
        "name": "pros",
        "selector": ".pros-list",
        "type": "list"
      },
      {
        "name": "cons",
        "selector": ".cons-list",
        "type": "list"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## How AI Enhances Scraping

1. **Pre-Scraping**:
   - Analyzes URL patterns to predict content relevance
   - Suggests additional related URLs to scrape
   - Validates extraction rules

2. **During Scraping**:
   - Adapts to dynamic content and layout changes
   - Identifies and extracts key information even when selectors fail
   - Filters out low-quality or irrelevant content

3. **Post-Scraping**:
   - Cleans and normalizes extracted data
   - Enriches data with additional context and relationships
   - Identifies trends and patterns across scraped content

## Best Practices

1. **Cost Management**:
   - Start with lower limits and adjust based on usage
   - Monitor daily usage patterns
   - Use GPT-3.5 Turbo for most tasks

2. **Concurrent Requests**:
   - Start with 2-3 concurrent requests
   - Increase if needed for better throughput
   - Stay within OpenAI's rate limits

3. **Topic Configuration**:
   - Start with specific, well-defined topics
   - Use clear URL patterns
   - Define essential extraction fields

## Troubleshooting

1. **High Costs**:
   - Review daily/monthly limits
   - Check if URLs are being filtered effectively
   - Consider using more specific URL patterns

2. **Slow Performance**:
   - Adjust concurrent request limit
   - Check if URLs are being processed efficiently
   - Monitor rate limiting and errors

3. **Poor Data Quality**:
   - Review extraction rules
   - Check if selectors are still valid
   - Consider using more specific topic definitions
