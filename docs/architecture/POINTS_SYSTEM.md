# RhinoSpider Points System

## Overview

The RhinoSpider points system rewards users for contributing their bandwidth and computing resources to the network. Points are calculated based on various metrics and can be used for rewards or privileges within the system.

## Points Calculation

### Base Points

1. **Bandwidth Contribution**
   - 1 point per MB of data processed
   - Calculated from both uploaded and downloaded bytes
   - Formula: `points = (bytesProcessed / (1024 * 1024)) * POINTS_PER_MB`

2. **Request Processing**
   - 10 points per successful request
   - Formula: `points = requestCount * POINTS_PER_REQUEST`

### Multipliers and Bonuses

1. **Quality Multiplier (20%)**
   - Based on successful vs failed requests
   - Success rate affects point earning
   - Formula: `successRate = successCount / (successCount + failureCount)`
   - Bonus: `(basePoints) * (successRate * 0.2)`

2. **Streak Bonus (10% per day)**
   - +10% points for each consecutive day
   - Caps at 100% (10 days)
   - Formula: `bonus = basePoints * (streak * 0.1)`

3. **Peak Hours Bonus (20%)**
   - +20% points during high-demand periods (9 AM - 5 PM local time)
   - Formula: `bonus = basePoints * 0.2` (if during peak hours)

4. **Resource Optimization (5% per topic)**
   - +5% points per additional topic being processed
   - Caps at 25% (5 topics)
   - Formula: `bonus = basePoints * (0.05 * min(topicsCount, 5))`

## Daily Points Cap

To ensure fair distribution and prevent abuse:
- Maximum 1000 points per day
- Points reset at UTC midnight
- All bonuses are calculated before cap is applied

## Real-time Tracking

The system tracks the following metrics in real-time:
1. Bandwidth usage (MB)
2. Requests processed
3. Success/failure rates
4. Points earned
5. Active streak

Updates occur:
- Every 5 seconds for real-time stats
- Daily for point calculations and rewards

## Points Distribution

1. **Daily Rewards**
   - Points are calculated and distributed daily
   - Rewards are based on:
     - Total points earned
     - Quality of contribution
     - Consistency (streak)

2. **Bonus Periods**
   - Peak hours (9 AM - 5 PM local time)
   - High-demand topics
   - Special events
