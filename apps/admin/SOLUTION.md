# RhinoSpider Admin App Deployment Issue

## The Problem

1. The admin app canister (`sxsvc-aqaaa-aaaaj-az4ta-cai`) has lost its Wasm module.
2. The wallet canister (`bfjmy-ryaaa-aaaao-a36qq-cai`) is out of cycles.
3. We can't reinstall the Wasm module without cycles.

## Solution

You need to add cycles to your wallet canister. Here's how:

1. **Add cycles to your wallet canister**:
   ```bash
   # Convert ICP to cycles
   dfx ledger transfer --icp 1 --memo 1 a6dziw-g4yb3-xai4g-jwdlq-jbtjt-kihsf-pmvr4-re72x-zadqv-gdknp-yae
   
   # Wait for the transaction to be processed (a few minutes)
   
   # Check your cycles balance
   dfx wallet --network ic balance
   ```

2. **Reinstall the asset canister Wasm module**:
   ```bash
   # Download the asset canister Wasm module
   curl -L https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/raw/master/src/canisters/frontend/ic-frontend-canister/ic-frontend-canister.wasm -o asset-canister.wasm
   
   # Install it to your canister
   dfx canister --network ic install --mode=reinstall --wasm asset-canister.wasm sxsvc-aqaaa-aaaaj-az4ta-cai
   ```

3. **Deploy your assets**:
   ```bash
   # Create a temporary dfx.json
   cat > dfx.json << EOL
   {
     "canisters": {
       "admin_ui": {
         "frontend": {
           "entrypoint": "dist/index.html"
         },
         "source": [
           "dist/"
         ],
         "type": "assets",
         "id": "sxsvc-aqaaa-aaaaj-az4ta-cai"
       }
     },
     "defaults": {
       "build": {
         "args": "",
         "packtool": ""
       }
     },
     "networks": {
       "ic": {
         "providers": ["https://ic0.app"],
         "type": "persistent"
       }
     },
     "version": 1
   }
   EOL
   
   # Deploy your assets
   dfx deploy --network ic admin_ui
   ```

## Alternative: Use a Different Canister

If you can't add cycles to your wallet, you can create a new canister with a different controller that has cycles:

1. Create a new canister with a different identity that has cycles
2. Deploy your assets to that new canister
3. Update your application to point to the new canister

## File Name Explanation

The file names with random strings (like `index.flOe2csO.css`) are generated by Vite (the build tool). These random strings are content hashes that change whenever the file content changes. This is standard practice for modern web apps to enable long-term caching while ensuring users get the latest version when files change.
