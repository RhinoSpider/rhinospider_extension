# Search Proxy Client Testing Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to test the search proxy client functionality in the RhinoSpider extension. The search proxy client is responsible for fetching URLs for topics from the search proxy service.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Search Proxy Client
- Updated the search proxy client to correctly use the search proxy endpoint based on the proxy architecture
- Improved error handling and response processing
- Added functionality to load API password from storage
- Exported the `checkProxyHealth` function for testing purposes

### 2. Created Browser-Based Test Script
- Created a new test script (`test-search-proxy-browser.js`) that can be run in the browser extension environment
- Implemented tests for health check, URL fetching, and error handling
- Added detailed logging and result reporting

### 3. Updated Background Script
- Added a new debug function (`testSearchProxy`) to run the browser-based test script
- Renamed the existing test function to `testSearchProxyClientLegacy` to avoid conflicts
- Made both test functions available in the global scope for testing from the console

### 4. Created Test Instructions
- Created a test script with instructions for loading and testing the extension
- Provided step-by-step guidance for running the tests and interpreting the results

## Testing Instructions

1. **Load the extension in Chrome**:
   - Go to chrome://extensions
   - Enable "Developer mode" (top right)
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the "build" folder

2. **Open the background page console**:
   - Find "RhinoSpider" in the extensions list
   - Click "Details"
   - Under "Inspect views", click "background.html"

3. **Run the test in the console**:
   - Type: `rhinoSpiderDebug.testSearchProxy()`
   - Press Enter

4. **Review the test results in the console**:
   - Check if the health check was successful
   - Verify if URLs were returned for the test topics
   - Look for any errors in the console

5. **Test with real topics** (optional):
   - Type: `rhinoSpiderDebug.testSearchProxyClientLegacy()`
   - This will use actual topics from the extension

## Expected Results

The test should return a result object with the following properties:
- `success`: Boolean indicating if the test was successful
- `healthCheck`: Boolean indicating if the health check was successful
- `topicsWithUrls`: Number of topics that received URLs
- `totalUrlsReturned`: Total number of URLs returned across all topics
- `message`: Success message

If the test fails, it will return an error object with:
- `success`: false
- `error`: Error message
- `stack`: Error stack trace
- `message`: Failure message

## Troubleshooting

If the test fails, check the following:
1. Verify that the search proxy service is running and accessible
2. Check that the API password is correct
3. Look for any CORS errors in the console
4. Verify that the URLs in the search proxy client are correct

## Next Steps

After successful testing, the search proxy client can be integrated into the main extension functionality. This will allow the extension to fetch real URLs for topics instead of using mock data.
