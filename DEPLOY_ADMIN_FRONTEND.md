# DEPLOY ADMIN FRONTEND MANUALLY

## âœ… STORAGE CANISTER DEPLOYED
The storage canister is now updated with the `getAllData` method and deployed to:
`hhaip-uiaaa-aaaao-a4khq-cai`

## âœ… ADMIN FRONTEND BUILT  
The admin frontend has been built with debug messages removed:
- Path: `apps/admin/dist/`
- No more "BigInt serialization handler installed"
- No more "Creating new auth client..." messages

## ðŸ“‹ MANUAL DEPLOYMENT STEPS

Since dfx doesn't have the asset canister config, deploy manually:

### Option 1: Use IC Dashboard
1. Go to https://nns.ic0.app/
2. Login with your Internet Identity
3. Navigate to "Canisters" â†’ `sxsvc-aqaaa-aaaaj-az4ta-cai`
4. Upload the files from `apps/admin/dist/` directory

### Option 2: Use ic-asset CLI
```bash
# Install ic-asset if needed
npm install -g ic-asset

# Deploy assets
ic-asset --network ic --canister sxsvc-aqaaa-aaaaj-az4ta-cai sync apps/admin/dist/
```

### Option 3: Use dfx asset commands
```bash
# If dfx recognizes the canister
dfx canister --network ic call sxsvc-aqaaa-aaaaj-az4ta-cai store '(record{key="/index.html"; content_type="text/html"; content=blob "..."})' 
```

## âœ… FIXES APPLIED
- **Storage Canister**: Now has `getAllData` method âœ…
- **Admin Frontend**: No debug messages âœ…  
- **Consumer Canister**: Has `getAllUsers` method âœ…
- **IC Proxy**: Simplified and deployed âœ…

Once the admin frontend is deployed, both errors should be resolved:
1. No more "getAllData method not found"  
2. No more debug console messages
