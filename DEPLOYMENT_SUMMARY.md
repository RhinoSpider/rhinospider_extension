# RhinoSpider Deployment Summary

## Date: August 11, 2025

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Extension Scraping Issues
- **Problem**: Extension wasn't opening tabs for content scraping
- **Solution**: 
  - Added comprehensive logging to track scraping flow
  - Fixed tab-based scraping implementation with proper consent handling
  - Created debug scripts for testing tab creation and scraping
- **Status**: Code deployed, requires manual extension reload in Chrome

### 2. Admin Panel Authorization
- **Problem**: Admin panel showing "checkIsAdmin is not a function" error
- **Solution**:
  - Verified checkIsAdmin method exists on backend canister
  - Rebuilt and redeployed admin frontend with correct IDL
- **Status**: Deployed to IC network

### 3. Search Proxy Rate Limiting
- **Problem**: 429 errors preventing URL fetching
- **Solution**: Increased daily quota from 50 to 10,000 for basic tier
- **Status**: Previously deployed to Digital Ocean (143.244.133.154)

2. a4kj7-zxayv-chbcy-xugju-sv5ct-qvah7-6qcet-zkoz2-ehngi-bcg5c-eqe
3. bqxlx-h2izi-dhfzv-lziks-v7mku-736zh-l3pot-ktlcf-hrcsg-zbgxr-lae

## Required User Actions

### 1. Reload Chrome Extension
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Remove RhinoSpider extension completely
3. Clear Chrome cache (Cmd+Shift+R or Empty Cache and Hard Reload)
4. Load unpacked extension from `/Users/ayanuali/development/rhinospider/apps/extension/dist`
5. Login to the extension
6. Check background page console for critical logs

### 2. Test Admin Panel
1. Visit https://sxsvc-aqaaa-aaaaj-az4ta-cai.icp0.io/
2. Login with Internet Identity
3. Verify you can access admin features with one of the authorized principals

### 3. Verify Extension Scraping
1. Open extension background page (chrome://extensions/ → RhinoSpider → service worker)
2. Run test script: `rhinoSpiderDebug.startScraping()`
3. Look for tabs being created and content being scraped
4. Check for "[CRITICAL]" logs in console

## Debug Scripts Created

Located in `/Users/ayanuali/development/rhinospider/apps/extension/`:
- `test-tab-creation.js` - Verifies tab creation works
- `debug-extension-state.js` - Shows complete extension state
- `test-scraping.js` - Tests scraping functionality
- `RELOAD_EXTENSION_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Detailed reload instructions

## Known Issues Remaining

1. **Extension Tab Creation**: If tabs still don't open after reload, the browser may be caching the old service worker. Try:
   - Chrome restart
   - Clear all Chrome data for the extension
   - Use incognito mode for testing

2. **Admin Panel Login**: If login still fails, clear browser cookies for the admin domain and try again

## Monitoring

- Extension logs: Check background page console for "[CRITICAL]" prefixed messages
- Admin panel: Check browser console for authentication errors
- Search proxy: SSH to Digital Ocean and run `pm2 logs search-proxy`

## Next Steps if Issues Persist

1. For extension: Try disabling all other extensions and test in a clean Chrome profile
2. For admin: Check browser console for specific error messages about IDL or actor creation
3. For search proxy: Check PM2 status with `pm2 list` on Digital Ocean server
